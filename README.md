## Overview
Crosshair X is a powerful software tool designed for gamers, providing extensive customization options for in-game crosshairs, particularly for shooter games. If you've ever wondered how to create the perfect crosshair for games like Rust or CS:GO, Crosshair X is the solution. It offers a range of preset options, as well as the ability to design your own custom crosshair from scratch using a flexible editor.

Users can customize the color, size, line thickness, and placement of the crosshair, tailoring it to their preferences. Additionally, the program allows you to set specific reactions for the lines based on different in-game conditions.

This tool greatly enhances aiming precision in games like CS:GO, Fortnite, and survival titles like Rust, where a center mark might be missing from the screen. It even integrates with Xbox and Game Bar, enabling seamless crosshair selection based on your preferred style. The "Lines" section lets you adjust the width and positioning of the crosshair lines, and these can be made transparent or bright to stand out clearly against the background. In the "Center Dot" area, you can adjust the properties of the central dot, choosing its color and size to match your exact specifications.

## User Experience
Crosshair X is extremely user-friendly, using sliders to fine-tune every aspect of your overlay. You can also share custom designs with friends or upload any image to use as a crosshair, adding a personal touch and a social element to your gameplay. The tool also offers features like switching sight visibility, managing multiple saved presets for different games, and exporting your custom crosshairs in PNG or SVG formats.

What sets Crosshair X apart from other similar tools is its depth of customization. You can adjust everything from line opacity and length to rotation, and tweak the center point, outlines, and other features. One particularly unique feature is the Bloom effect, which causes the crosshair to expand when you shoot, adding a layer of realism to your gameplay.

## Limitations
Despite its many advantages, no tool is without drawbacks. A key issue to note is that when playing certain games in full-screen mode, the crosshair may freeze or fail to appear entirely. However, you can still use it in windowed mode, though some input lag may be experienced in this setup.
